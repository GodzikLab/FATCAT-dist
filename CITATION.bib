    abstract = "{FATCAT 2.0 serverÂ (http://fatcat.godziklab.org/), provides access to a flexible protein structure alignment algorithm developed in our group. In such an alignment, rotations and translations between elements in the structure are allowed to minimize the overall root mean square deviation (RMSD) between the compared structures. This allows to effectively compare protein structures even if they underwent structural rearrangements in different functional forms, different crystallization conditions or as a result of mutations. The major update for the server introduces a new graphical interface, much faster database searches and several new options for visualization of the structural differences between proteins}",
